# Defense Strategy Against Data Bouncing Techniques

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and tools for implementing a robust defense strategy against data bouncing techniques. Data bouncing involves the unauthorized use of DNS queries and HTTP headers for data exfiltration. Our approach is multi-layered, focusing on DNS and HTTP traffic monitoring, web application security enhancement, and secure DNS configuration.
